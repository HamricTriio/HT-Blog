Happy Thanksgiving! As of today, (work in progress) HamricTriio: Access Edition has entered entered into an open-testing phase of development. Accessibility testing will be our next step, as the theme has been setup as close to HTML as possible, while still syncing with a notes application, called Obsidian. Posts from M, L, and A, are possible, along with shared posts from HamricTriio. There is also a Main version in the works of this site, designed for the visual users. The Current version, set to sync across both sites,  has been designed for the blind or visually impaired, making posts easily accessible to those using screen readers. In the mean time, stay tuned for more updates from HamricTriio. We have more coming!
